The famous scene: baby crying in fear at Hektor's bronze helmet with its horsehair plume. Hektor laughing gently, removing his intimidating helmet. Then Hektor holding his son tenderly, praying to the gods for the child's future. Touching father-son moment. Reference De Chirico's 1917 surrealist painting style if possible.
